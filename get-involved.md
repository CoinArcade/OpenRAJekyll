## Getting Involved

As a small team developing OpenRA in our free time, your input is valuable to us. Anything from writing bug reports/feedback, to contributing new features or fixing bugs is welcomed with open arms.

### Contact Us

The developers can be found on our <a title="#openra on Freenode" href="irc://chat.freenode.net/openra">IRC channel</a> most of the time so if you have any suggestions, that is the best place to contact us.

### Bug tracker

If you wish to report a bug, our bug tracker can be found here:  
<a title="OpenRA Bugtracker" href="http://bugs.open-ra.org">http://bugs.open-ra.org</a>

### Obtaining the Source Code

You'll need several things in order to checkout and build the source code:

- [Git] [git] 
- [.NET Framework 3.5 SP1] [dotnet] or later, on Windows, or [Mono 2.6.x] [mono] on other platforms.
- GNU Make, on non-Windows platforms.
- Visual Studio 2008 (or [Visual C# Express] [vs], free) if you like a nice IDE.

Grab the sources by cloning our git repository:

<pre>$ git clone git://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA.git
$ cd OpenRA</pre>

Follow the instructions in INSTALL to build and run the game.
