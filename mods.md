## Built-In Mods

OpenRA is a highly moddable RTS game engine, in fact both Red Alert and Command & Conquer are implemented purely as mods on it.

<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px"><img src="/assets/themes/openra/images/mod_ra.png" alt="RA" width="105" height="105" title=""/></div>

The RA mod for OpenRA is a reimagining of Command & Conquer Red Alert. It is not just a clone of the original but has improved and rebalanced gameplay. It has fully working multiplayer support for both internet and local play (via direct connect).

<h3 style="clear: both;">Command &amp; Conquer</h3>

<div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px"><img src="/assets/themes/openra/images/mod_cnc.png" alt="CNC" width="113" height="113" title=""/></div>

The CNC mod for OpenRA is a reimagining of the original Command & Conquer game. It has fully working multiplayer support for both internet and local play (via direct connect). A single player campaign is currently being worked on.
